# We will only use data files in the YAML format

  - yaml

# This is where the data files will be located

:hierarchy:
  # Common values that can not be overloaded by system specific datafiles are in 'global.yaml'
  - global
  # Data specific to a node. Ex: node/ncepaas0024.yaml
  # This works in a puppet apply or in hiera by appending "hostname=cubitus"
  - "node/%{hostname}"
  # This works with hiera with option "--json facter.json" where JSON file is output of "facter --json"
  #- "node/%{networking.hostname}"
  # This works with hiera with option "--json facts.json" where JSON file is output of "puppet facts"
  #- "node/%{values.hostname}"
  #- "node/%{values.networking.hostname}"
  # Defaults values that can be overloaded by system specific data are in 'defaults.yaml'
